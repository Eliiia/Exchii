# ExchangeBot
(abandoned now, also renamed to Exchii everywhere except github for some reason)

Hi!
I started work on this wayyy before I put it on Github, however I thought it'd be nice to have it on Github. I occasionally come back on to this project to say something.

# future greg here
i thought i was going to actually work on the bot when i put it up on github, but i did not
if you'd really like me to pick this up again do say i guess, but if i do it'll probably be a more general bot

if you're here as a reference or something i truly do recommend [this] (https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot), as it shows the entirety of bot creation, and is constantly up to date (as its open source). won't help much if you don't know how code works, though, but neither will this
